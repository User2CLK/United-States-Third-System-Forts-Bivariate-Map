# United-States-Third-System-Forts-Bivariate-Map
The code in this repository shows the Third System forts along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico in the US and has a choropleth map showing the how many Third System forts each state on the East Coast has. The icons are also styled after a chess rook piece and are colored based on the region along the East Coast each fort resides in.
